  "about_p1": "I started in <span class=\"highlight-green\">IT</span>, but I discovered something important: <span class=\"highlight\">I'm terrible at complex backend logic</span>. And that's okay. Because my brain is wired for other things.",
  "about_p2": "I look at a website and automatically think: '<span class=\"highlight-orange\">that button is poorly positioned</span>,' '<span class=\"highlight-orange\">those colors don't convey trust</span>,' '<span class=\"highlight-orange\">this flow confuses the user</span>.' I can't help it. While others think about algorithms, <span class=\"highlight\">I think about experiences</span>.",
