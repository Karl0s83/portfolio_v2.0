# Portfolio v2.0 – Carlos Escribano Tiñena

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio. This project has been designed following a **Bento Grid** approach, prioritizing a dark, modern, and highly functional aesthetic.

## Key Features

- **Bento Grid Design**: Modular and responsive layout that organizes information in a clear and visually appealing way.
- **Multilanguage (i18n)**: Native support for Spanish (ES), Catalan (CA), and English (EN) without page reloads.
- **Dark Mode**: Carefully selected color palette (`#161616` and `#0d0d0d`) for an elegant visual experience.
- **Interactive Tech Stack**: Tab-based navigation (“Hard Skills” / “Soft Skills”) with smooth animations.
- **Dynamic WhatsApp Contact**: Contact link that generates a personalized message based on the user’s language.
- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Technologies

This project is built using standard web technologies, without heavy dependencies:

- **Semantic HTML5**: Clean and accessible structure.
- **Modern CSS3**: CSS variables, Flexbox, Grid Layout, and custom animations.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lightweight logic for language switching, tabs, and dynamic features.
- **Google Fonts**: *Outfit* typeface for a modern look.
- **Font Awesome**: Vector-based icons.

## 🧠 Design & Development Process

The development of this portfolio was not linear, but the result of several iterations aimed at finding the right balance between **aesthetics and functionality**:

1. **“Bento Grid” Concept**  
   The main idea was to move away from the typical infinite vertical portfolio. I chose a modular grid-based structure that allows recruiters to quickly see **who I am, what I do, and how to contact me** at a glance.

2. **Visual Evolution (Glassmorphism → Dark Premium)**  
   Initially, I experimented with strong glassmorphism effects. During development, I refined the design toward a more **clean and professional** style (`#161616`), prioritizing readability and contrast while keeping subtle modern touches through gradients and borders.

3. **Technical Decisions (No Frameworks)**  
   I consciously decided to use **Vanilla CSS and JavaScript** to demonstrate solid knowledge of modern web fundamentals (Grid, Flexbox, ES6+) and to ensure instant load times and good performance.
